Quick start guide (OpenGL support)
----------------------------------

1. Add this PPA: https://launchpad.net/~thopiekar/+archive/emgd

2. Install the emgd driver ("emgd-drm-dkms" and "xserver-xorg-1.9-video-emgd" are minimum)

3. Prepare the emgd module to be loaded

    3.1 Create a file in /etc/modprobe.d/ (e.g. blacklist-emgd.conf) and fill it with the following content

    ```
    blacklist gma500_gfx
    blacklist psb_gfx
    ```

    3.2 Add "emgd" to /etc/modules as it is not automaticly loaded at boot-time (fix for that is welcome!)
    
    3.3 For xUbuntu/Debian: Running "update-initramfs -u -kall" as root might be useful!

4. Create a xorg.conf on your own xorg.conf 

    4.1 (emgd-xorg-conf which I wrote in the past does not work with EMGD 1.10+ [at least on my Asus T91])

    4.2 You can find templetes at /usr/share/doc/emgd/emgd-[cb/rv].conf

    4.3 don't forget to set there your resolution and color depth

4. Make sure Xserver-xorg v1.9 and mesa v7.9 are properly installed
