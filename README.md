Quick start guide (OpenGL support)
----------------------------------

1. Add this PPA: https://launchpad.net/~thopiekar/+archive/emgd

2. Install the emgd driver ("emgd-drm-dkms" and "xserver-xorg-1.9-video-emgd" are minimum)

3.1 Create a file in /etc/modprobe.d/ (e.g. blacklist-emgd.conf) and fill it with the following content

```
blacklist psb_gfx
```

3.2 Add "emgd" to /etc/modules as it is not automaticly loaded at boot-time (fix for that is welcome!)

4. Create a xorg.conf on your own xorg.conf 

    3.1 (emgd-xorg-conf which I wrote in the past does not work with EMGD 1.10+ [at least on my Asus T91])

    3.2 You can find templetes at /usr/share/doc/emgd/emgd-[cb/rv].conf

    3.3 don't forget to set there your resolution and color depth

4. Make sure Xserver-xorg v1.9 and mesa v7.9 are properly installed
