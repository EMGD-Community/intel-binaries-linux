EMGD<a
 name="Xaa1017194"></a> supports only one type of SDVO-HDMI encoder, which
is CH7315. SDVO-B cannot coexist with HDMI-B; SDVO-C cannot coexist with
HDMI-C.</p>
<p class="body"><a
 name="Xaa1017197"></a>SDVO takes precedence over the HDMI port driver.
If no SDVO encoder is available HDMI is automatically loaded by default
(only in the GM45 Express chipset).</p>

<p class="body"><a
 name="Xaa1017199"></a>Internal HDMI is available only for the GM45 Express
chipset. Only one HDMI port has audio at any one time. The first port
in the port order has audio while the second port would have only display
without audio.</p>
<p class="body"><a
 name="Xaa1017200"></a>Only one HDMI port has HDCP at any one time. The
first port to receive a request for HDCP has HDCP enabled only in that
port.</p>
