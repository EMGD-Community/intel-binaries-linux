==========

Q: In MeeGo 1.2, I'm getting errors related to libva and missing files.
A: Check that your environment variable 'LIBVA_DRIVERS_PATH' is not set. 
If it is, unset it.
e.g., `unset LIBVA_DRIVERS_PATH`

Q: When installing GStreamer in MeeGo*, I get the 'fedora repo not found' error.
A: Make sure you decompressed the files from the / directory.

Q: I installed the EMGD RPM in MeeGo* 1.2, but it's not working!
A: The full installation process involves more than just the RPM installation.
   Please see the User Guide for the complete process.
